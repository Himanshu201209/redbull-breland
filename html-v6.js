                  Walking down Fifth Avenue on a Wednesday afternoon in downtown

                  and Crocs in “sport mode” are moving slowly as they visit
                  local tourist spots, while working people in attire ranging
                  from business to construction are rushing back to their jobs
                  after eating lunch. Moving at his own pace, country artist
                  Breland is living both of those paths as he wraps up the last
                  leg of a playful, hours-long photo shoot on a balmy day in
                  late June. <br /><br />The day began at contemporary
                  residential skyscraper 505 Nashville. Throughout the shoot,
                  Breland is open to the photographer’s spontaneity, despite it
                  requiring multiple elevator trips and calls to the building
                  staff for key-card access. One minute he’s shooting pool at
                  the game room on the seventh floor of the apartment renters’
                  wing; the next he’s playing John Legend’s “Ordinary People” on
                  the Yamaha grand piano inside the luxe eighth-floor lounge for
                  the building’s condo owners. As the day goes on, residents’
                  facial expressions range between an inquisitive “who?” when
                  they see him with a camera crew and an annoyed “why?” when
                  they can’t fit on the elevator with them. Breland responds to
                  both with the same pleasantries.<br /><br />505 Nashville has
                  a commanding presence in the city, standing 45 stories tall,
                  with a glass facade that reflects every color in the sky. But
                  the photo shoot’s next location, the historic Ryman
                  Auditorium, with its arched stained-glass windows, still
                  manages to tower over it with 132 years of music history.<br /><br />Formerly
                  home to the legendary Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman is flanked by
                  statues honoring some of its past performers, all of whom left
                  their marks on country music. Among them are pioneering female
                  singer and guitarist Loretta Lynn, bluegrass music creator
                  Bill Monroe, and its latest addition, Charlie Pride, who is
                  known as the first Black superstar in country music.

                    While Breland is a long way from getting bronzed, the
                    gold-and platinum-selling 29-year-old singer-songwriter
                    already has a mainstay presence at the venue and is becoming
                    hard to ignore.

                  Ever since crashing onto the music scene with his 2019 viral
                  hit “My Truck,” Breland has been on a mission to change the
                  way people view country music and Black people’s position in
                  it. The song emerged on the heels of Lil Nas X’s crossover
                  smash “Old Town Road” and Blanco Brown’s dance anthem “The Git
                  Up” and a year before Nelly’s collaboration with country duo
                  Florida Georgia Line, “Lil Bit.” All of which feature Black
                  men as the lead vocalist on a country song, foreshadowing the
                  current larger wave of Black artists swerving over into the
                  country lane. <br /><br />Going on to plant his flag with
                  2020’s Breland EP and his 2022 debut album
                  <span class="italic-rb"><em>Cross Country</em></span> ,
                  Breland<span class="highlight-text"> </span>quickly became one
                  of country music’s most sought-after collaborators due to his
                  exceptional songwriting and penchant for melody. Just four
                  years into his solo career he’s already been on tour with
                  country queen Shania Twain, co-written two songs with
                  Grammy-winning star Keith Urban and won an Academy of Country
                  Music Award (in 2023). This June he was named a Global Music
                  Ambassador for the U.S. State Department alongside artists
                  like Chuck D of Public Enemy and Herbie Hancock, who will all
                  be tasked with “elevating music as a diplomatic platform to
                  expand access to education, economic opportunity and equity,
                  and inclusion.”

                    his annual “Breland &amp; Friends” benefit concert at the
                    Ryman, where a long list of music superstars, including Josh
                    Groban and Nelly, have joined him on stage to perform duets
                    and create a slew of one-night-only memories for sold-out
                    crowds. Last year’s show produced a live album, and to date,
                    the event series has raised more than $300,000 for the Oasis
                    Center, an organization dedicated to helping youth in Middle
                    Tennessee, with services ranging from crisis intervention to
                    college prep.<br /><br />With so much on his plate—including
                    opening for fellow genre-mashing artist Teddy Swims’s tour

                    on this walk he’s taking. But with the path that he’s helped
                    to clear getting more occupied by the day, he doesn’t feel
                    like he can slow down right now.

                    says Breland, literally counting the names on one hand as he
                    recites them. “Now there’s probably 15 to 20 Black artists
                    that have deals and are putting music out. Beyoncé coming
                    into this space changes the landscape, and now there’s more

                  <span class="highlight-text">The story of Breland </span>and
                  his breakthrough song “My Truck” has been well documented. The
                  track, produced by Kal V and veteran songwriter Troy Taylor,
                  features Breland harmonizing about Air Jordans, blunts, V8
                  engines and plenty of other things Americans of all races
                  enjoy, over trap drums met with guitar picking.<br />‍<br />Originally
                  released independently, the song picked up major momentum
                  online, leading to Breland signing a record deal with Atlantic
                  Records in 2020. The natural order of things was supposed to
                  go: Take the song to radio, get it played, put out an EP and
                  go on tour. But just as that plan was coming to fruition, the
                  world stopped due to the coronavirus pandemic and the
                  subsequent quarantine restrictions that came with it.

                  “We took ‘My Truck’ to pop radio literally a week before the
                  pandemic hit,” remembers Breland, whose self-titled EP still
                  dropped in May 2020 in hopes of salvaging some of the lost
                  momentum. “<span class="regular"
                    >They didn’t do anything because people aren’t commuting to
                    and from work anymore, so nobody’s listening to the
                    radio.</span

                  While radio and touring were no longer options, streaming
                  still helped the project move along, with “My Truck” earning a
                  gold plaque that August and then a platinum one the following
                  January. (In June 2024, the single eclipsed the
                  double-platinum mark for selling 2 million copies.) So the
                  Breland EP served to introduce the singer-songwriter to
                  audiences in the country and hip-hop/R&amp;B worlds who may
                  have been curious about what each other were doing, but not so
                  much that they would come over and introduce themselves.

              “That doesn’t really happen a whole lot in music because it tends
              to be segmented and the music industry has made it that way.
              There’s a lot of history to support that. So I knew that what I
              was doing was different and that it did have the chance to build a
              bridge between cultures that don’t always have anything at their
              epicenter.”<br />‍<br />While it would be nice to think that
              technology has flattened the fences and made everything available
              to everybody all at once, that is only partially true. Because of
              algorithms, curated playlists and other metrics that continue to
              shape listeners’ tastes, it can be argued that audiences are as
              segregated as ever. In theory, a hardcore hip-hop head can click
              on a digital service provider’s “Hot Country Music” playlist out
              of sheer curiosity. Just like a lifelong country music fanatic
              could do the same with an R&amp;B playlist. But if there’s nothing
              or no one there framing it in a way that would help them
              understand the music or the people behind it, it’s not likely they
              would take any real interest. It’s Breland’s hope that music like
              his can be that introduction past the marketing and closer to the
              idea that people can find and appreciate what they have in common.

              “I think country music and hip-hop are really two sides of the
              same coin,” says Breland. “You’ve got people that are expressing
              themselves in a way that doesn’t have any rules. To me, what makes
              that album a country album is that in its own way it is telling
              stories, and I think hip-hop does the same thing. It’s just using
              different language, production and instrumentation, but it’s the
              same thing.”

              At age 29, it has taken some contrasting life experiences for
              Breland to arrive at seeing things that way. Born and raised in
              Burlington, New Jersey, Daniel Gerard Breland grew up exclusively
              around gospel music, as both of his parents were ordained
              ministers who also recorded and performed music themselves,
              touring churches and other small venues. With the town being just
              40 minutes northeast of Philadelphia, he was also raised in the
              religion of sports, which explains why his Instagram feed mostly
              features videos of him singing or giving game predictions—or, at
              his apex, singing the game predictions.<br /><br />Brought up in a
              musical household, Breland says he and his siblings had to learn
              how to sing whether or not they planned on pursuing the craft
              professionally. Luckily for him, when he did decide to do music
              for a living, he had tons of research to pull from.<br /><br />“One
              of the benefits of growing up in an environment like that is we
              had Pro Tools when I was 9 years old,” says Breland of the popular
              audio software, adding that seeing his parents hold down day jobs
              while also producing music kept him inspired when he found himself
              in the same situation starting his own career. “So now I have 20
              years of Pro Tools experience where, if I’m in a studio and the
              engineer is moving too slow, I’m like, ‘Get out the way, bro—I’m
              about to just sit down and get this done myself.’ It brings me a
              lot of joy to be able to record myself, because it is a very
              grounding and fundamental experience from my childhood.”

                  It wasn’t until he left home and went to boarding school at
                  the Peddie School in nearby Hightstown, New Jersey, in his
                  teenage years that he was exposed to other genres like
                  R&amp;B, rock and rap. Up to this point, the only experience
                  he had actually doing music was singing in his school and
                  church choirs or singing background for his older siblings in
                  impromptu performances at home. Now that he was out on his
                  own, he wanted to try making this new music he was hearing. It
                  was here that he started working with his roommate, who had
                  the tools and instruments to help him do just that.<br /><br />“The
                  way my brain works just as a musician, when I hear two songs
                  that are totally different, I’m immediately thinking of how
                  they’re similar,” says Breland.

                  Breland’s different way began to take shape when he declined
                  admission into NYU’s highly coveted Clive Davis Institute for
                  Recorded Music to instead study business at Georgetown
                  University. He explains the decision simply, stating, “I
                  already knew how to make music” and instead wanted to learn
                  the business side of the industry he dreamed of entering.
                  While at Georgetown, he joined the university’s long-running a
                  cappella group, the Phantoms, but off-campus he began dabbling
                  with rap music, linking with producers Austin Powerz and Lee
                  on the Beats, often working out of DJ Khaled’s New York City
                  studio. Breland is the first one to admit that, as a studious
                  college student raised in the church, he felt like a fish out
                  of water in that environment. But he notes that he was able to
                  connect with everyone in the room because they all spoke the
                  language of music.<br /><br />“Regardless of what everybody
                  else was into in their personal lives or in their social
                  lives, I knew when we got in the studio to make music, they
                  could respect me as their peer because I’m gonna come up with
                  melodies and I’m gonna come up with lyrics,” he says.<br /><br />Unfortunately,
                  activities in people’s personal lives are exactly what
                  eventually impacted his decision to move on. One of the main
                  artists with whom he’d built a rapport—a rappper from Queens
                  and protégé of French Montana named Chinx—was gunned down at
                  an intersection in 2015, changing Breland’s mind about what
                  avenue he wanted to take into the music industry.

                  “It really rocked me because I hadn’t really been exposed to
                  that kind of violence,” says Breland, adding that had it not
                  been for Chinx telling him to stay in the studio and finish
                  the songs they were working on, he would have been in the car
                  with him that night.

                of Breland’s walk took him where most people in his situation
                go: Atlanta. While the nicknames like “the Black Mecca” and “the
                Motown of the South” have begun to grow gray hairs, the city
                still remains a hotbed for young Black musicians looking to get
                to the next level—the catch being that there are so many of
                them.<br /><br />“I personally loved how many people there were
                in Atlanta that were trying to make music, because it felt like
                it gave me a bit of a community,” says Breland, responding to
                the notion that being yet another Black person in Atlanta making
                music could lead to being completely overlooked.

                    To Breland, the “Nashville perspective” means creating
                    melodies and writing lyrics that, as he simply puts it “make
                    sense,” instead of relying on a stream of consciousness,
                    just saying things that sound cool. This linear approach to
                    songwriting slowly started to get Breland noticed in
                    industry circles, catching the ear of people like the
                    previously mentioned Taylor, which led to getting placements
                    with artists like Trey Songz, YK Osiris and Elhae. While
                    reading his name on album cover credits felt great,
                    opportunities were still trickling instead of flooding,
                    leading to him taking a corporate job and working a side gig
                    as a vocal coach to make ends meet. Around this time,
                    Breland was also starting to wonder if he was being
                    pigeonholed. He knew he could sing but was advised to remain
                    a writer. He listened to different musical genres but was
                    only being approached to write in the hip-hop, R&amp;B and
                    occasionally gospel spaces.

                  <div class="reveal-text">
                    Wanting to try something new, Breland got back into the
                    experimental phase he had first explored in high school. One
                    of the fruits of that phase, “My Truck,” wound up pushing
                    his career into four-wheel overdrive.

                <div class="learning-summary-block">
                  <p class="paragraph">
                    Soon after signing his deal, Breland relocated to Nashville,
                    sensing that the direction his music was going would be more
                    welcome there. Which was probably the best thing he could’ve
                    done at the time. Atlanta’s musical identity is a by-product
                    of its predominantly Black population, built on a legacy of
                    artists including Curtis Mayfield, Bobby Brown and OutKast.
                    It’s also the birthplace of trap music and home to multiple
                    Black megachurches. In such a crowded musical landscape,
                    there wasn’t much room for Breland to find his path to
                    success. Years prior, popular country singer Kane Brown had
                    a similar go at it, learning that being a Black country
                    artist in a Black city doesn’t always work before finally
                    moving to Nashville himself. Things were looking up for
                    Breland until March 2020, when the music industry slowed
                    down due to COVID.

                  Breland, 29, was photographed for The Red Bulletin at 505

                  Forced into quarantine like the rest of the world, Breland
                  figured that since everyone, including in-demand producers,
                  songwriters and artists were all at the house and not touring
                  or bouncing around studios as usual, he should shoot as many
                  shots as possible. This led to him forming online
                  relationships with dozens of people despite being new to town.
                  Those bonds would pay off in the form of a star-studded cast
                  joining him for his 2022 debut album
                  <span class="italic-rb">Cross Country</span>, featuring
                  appearances from the aforementioned Urban, Lady A, Mickey
                  Guyton and Thomas Rhett, with writing contributions from Sam
                  Sumser, Sam Hunt and Hardy to name a few. Some of these same
                  friends and more have performed at “Breland &amp; Friends”
                  too. A rolodex of this kind usually belongs to artists who
                  have already proven themselves with a string of hit records.
                  In Breland’s case, he garnered all of this support in less
                  than five years.

                  says Nashville-based country music reporter Marcus K. Dowling,
                  about how and why Breland can already be surrounded with such
                  talent. “So if you’re an A-plus-level songwriter or if you’re
                  a fantastic arranger-producer-composer and you’re also
                  somebody who understands exactly what a vocal should sound
                  like and you can do all of these things like Breland can? Then
                  when you put him into those rooms, he is immediately a person
                  of great value.”

                The success of “My Truck” came at a time when genres, especially
                hip-hop and country, were beginning to flirt with each other
                more often, as more artists began to try different styles in
                hopes of reaching a larger audience. While the song’s clever
                songwriting and clean production kept it from being seen as a
                gimmick, there was still a hint of “oh that’s different” to the
                tune. But since then, more Black artists who were well known in
                rap and R&amp;B are stepping into cowboy boots, making it look
                normal while making history in the process.<br /><br />In 2022
                we saw Chicago drill rapper Lil Durk link up with country bad
                boy Morgan Wallen for the hit song “Broadway Girls.” The
                following year former
                <span class="italic-rb">Love &amp; Hip Hop</span> cast member K.
                Michelle announced she was leaving her R&amp;B career to start a
                new one in country. In spring 2024, Beyoncé’s single “Texas Hold
                ‘Em” from her album
                <span class="italic-rb"><em>Cowboy Carter</em></span> and
                Shaboozey’s “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” marked the first time two Black
                recording artists consecutively occupied the No.1 spot on the
                Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. (Both songs peaked at No. 1
                on the <span class="italic-rb"><em>Billboard</em></span> Hot
                100, too.) In the months after that we’ve seen Quavo of Migos
                enter the country chart with his Lana Del Rey collaboration
                “Tough,” and LVRN, a label known for acts like 6lack and Summer
                Walker, sign their first country artist, Tanner Adell, off the
                strength of her trap-tinged country song “Buckle Bunny.”

                  Where many artists could view more people entering a lane as
                  competition for attention, Breland still views it as an
                  opportunity for everyone to thrive. But, as he stands on the
                  sidewalk between Pride’s statue at the Ryman and the National
                  Museum of African American Music right across the street, he

                  says Breland, well aware that the awards show is being taped
                  in Los Angeles the same weekend we are speaking. As of 2024,
                  there are no country music categories at the awards show.
                  “We’re still probably a couple years away from that, but I do
                  think it would be great, because we’re probably not going to
                  fully be able to break down some of those other barriers
                  within the country music world. So why not try something else?
                  There’s a lot of artists in this space now that are making
                  music at a high level. And I just think that exposure on a
                  night like that would be really dope, man.”
